## Introduction

Digital twins create a virtual representation of physical systems. In this project, we use a digital twin to model a line-follower robot. The robot can follow a line on the ground using sensors. This repository integrates various technologies to provide a comprehensive learning experience.

## Features

- **PID Control**: The robot uses Proportional-Integral-Derivative control for precise movement.
- **UDP/TCP Synchronization**: The system supports both UDP and TCP protocols for data transmission.
- **HTTP Dashboard**: Users can monitor and control the robot through a web-based dashboard.
- **Unity 3D Virtual Model**: The virtual model allows users to simulate the robot's behavior in a controlled environment.
- **ESP32 Integration**: The project utilizes the ESP32 microcontroller for real-time processing.
- **Modular Design**: Users can modify hardware components easily.
- **Educational Focus**: Ideal for university students and robotics enthusiasts.

## Installation

To get started, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mins271/Design-and-Implementation-of-Digital-Twin-for-a-Line-Follower-Robot.git
cd Design-and-Implementation-of-Digital-Twin-for-a-Line-Follower-Robot
```

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- MATLAB
- Unity 3D
- ESP32 Development Environment
- Any necessary libraries for MATLAB and Unity

### Download and Execute

You can download the latest release from the [Releases](https://github.com/mins271/Design-and-Implementation-of-Digital-Twin-for-a-Line-Follower-Robot/releases) section. Follow the instructions in the release notes to execute the files.

## Usage

After setting up the project, follow these steps to use the digital twin:

1. **Connect the ESP32**: Make sure your ESP32 is connected to your computer.
2. **Run the MATLAB Controller**: Open MATLAB and run the controller script. This will initiate communication with the ESP32.
3. **Launch Unity**: Open the Unity project and run the simulation. You will see the virtual model of the robot.
4. **Monitor via HTTP Dashboard**: Access the dashboard through your web browser to control and monitor the robot's movements.

### Example

Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to control the robot:

```matlab
% MATLAB script to control the robot
robotSpeed = 5; % Speed of the robot
robotDirection = 'forward'; % Direction

sendCommand(robotSpeed, robotDirection); % Function to send command to ESP32
```
